# Matrix-Multiplication-using-Pig
 Project #1 (matrix multiplication) using Apache Pig. An empty multiply.pig is provided as well as scripts to run this code on Comet. The input matrices are the same as in Project1. There are two small sparce matrices 4*3 and 3*3 in the files M-matrix-small.txt and N-matrix-small.txt for testing in local mode. Their matrix multiplication must return the 4*3 matrix in result-matrix-small.txt. Then there are 2 moderate-sized matrices 200*100 and 100*300 in the files M-matrix-large.txt and M-matrix-large.txt for testing in distributed mode. Note: you can access the input matirces in Pig (which are passed as parameters) as $N and $M and the output as $O.
